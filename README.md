# 🔐 RSA Cryptosystem Project

### 🔮 About

The objective of this assignment is to create an (interactive) program implementing the RSA algorithm allowing to:

- Generate RSA keys (Cryptosystem)
- Encrypt an input message (Plaintext)
- Decrypt an encrypted message (Ciphertext)

### 💻 How does it work?

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt and click "🔓 Encrypt Message"
2. A pair of public and private key will be generated
3. Your plaintext is now in ciphertext
4. Enter the ciphertext and private key in the "🗝️ Decrypt a ciphertext"
5. Decrypt your message
